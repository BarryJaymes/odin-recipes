    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My wife asked me to make this over the years and we just never got to it. When I finally did end up putting it together, I was shocked at how so few simple ingredients made such a delicious meal. Everyone in the family loved it enough that it's now in our regular rotation!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken legs, cooked and shredded
        <li>2 cans cream of chicken or mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 box ritz crackers</li>
        <li>1 pkg broad egg noodles cooked according to pkg directions</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients except the crackers and butter.</li>
        <li>Pour into a 9x13 casserole dish, top with crushed crackers and dot with butter.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until top is crispy.</li>
    </ol>
