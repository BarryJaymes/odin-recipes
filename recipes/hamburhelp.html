    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My son wanted to try this when he saw it on the website. It quickly became a family favorite but the best part is how quickly it comes together. You can use milk, half and half, heavy cream, really whatever you want for the dairy here. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups sharp chedder cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine cornstarch, garlic powder, sugar, salt, paprika and pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the beef and onion until no pink remainds. Drain well.</li>
        <li>Add milk, broth, and macaroni to the beef. Stir the cornstarch and spice mixture. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat and let simmer, covered for 9 - 12 minutes or until cooked.  Stir occasionally and add liquid if needed.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in cheese until melted. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
