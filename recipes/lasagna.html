    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I use a lot of meat and as many cheeses as I can. Sadly after I made this a few times, nobody in the house will eat store-bought. Every time I see a new one, I try bringing it home, just for the kids to take one bite and ask when I'll be making the homemade version.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>4 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3lbs ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>3 cans pasta sauce</li>
        <li>1 container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 container cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup parsley</li>
        <li>1 egg beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>brown beef and onion on medium until no pink remains. Drain.</li>
        <li>Stir in pasta sauce and simmer for 5 minutes. Add water to thin, and seasonings to taste.</li>
        <li>combine 2 cups mozzarella cheese, with egg, parsley, garlic, ricotta and cottage cheese.</li>
        <li>spread a thin layer of sauce in pan. Top with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with 1/3 of the cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce.  Repeat twice more.  Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove foil, sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and bake 15 minutes until brown and bubbly</li>
        <li>Rest at least 15 minutes before cutting.</li>
    </ol>
